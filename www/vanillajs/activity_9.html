    /*
        In this activity we must find the minimum and maximum number in an array
        This can be done simply by using the Math.max and Math.min and spread operator ...
        const numbers = [25, 14, 56, 15, 36, 56, 77, 18, 29, 49];
        let min = Math.min(...numbers);
        let max = Math.max(...numbers);
        But we do a for loop again.
    */

    //the numbers we are working with in an array
    const numbers = [25, 14, 56, 15, 36, 56, 77, 18, 29, 49];
    // We define two new variables: min and max with index of numbers 0.
    let min = numbers[0];
    let max = numbers[0];

    //Now we loop through the list for each of the min and max:
    //We begin the iteration from the second element since we already have numbers set to first with index 0
    //This will make sure each of the number will be compared exactly once.
    for (let i = 1; i < numbers.length; i++) {

        //This checks if the current value is greater than max and updates max
        //with the current greater value
        if (numbers[i] > max) {
            max = numbers[i];
        }
        //This will check if the current value is less than the current min
        //then updates the min with the new less value
        if (numbers[i] < min) {
            min = numbers[i];
        }
    }

    //We can now log the results
    console.log(`Original Array: ${numbers}`)
    console.log(`Maximum value for the above array = ${max}`);
    console.log(`Minimum value for the avove array = ${min}`);
