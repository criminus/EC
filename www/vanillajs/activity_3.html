        is identical to third number

            alert('All numbers are equal.');

        //We check this by using the 'not equal' operator (!=) and 'or' operator (||)

        And for the last part, if none of the above, we let the user know
        that neither all are equal or different. Which based on our checks
        it will never actually happen.
