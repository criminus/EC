    In this activity we have to check if the numbers are in increasing order,
    decreasing order or neither.
    */

    //Again, our code should have 3 inputs with 3 different numbers so let's create them.
    let firstNum = window.prompt('Please enter the first number:');
    let secondNum = window.prompt('Please enter the second number:');
    let thirdNum = window.prompt('Please enter the third number:');

    /*
    Now we perform the basic first check if the numbers are increasing
    We use the operator '<' to check if the first number is smaller than second
    , second is smaller than third and first smaller than third. 
    Meaning, our numbers are increasing in value.
    For this check we don't use the 'or' (||) operator.
    We use 'and' (&&).
    If we use the 'or' operator this condition would return true if firstNum < secondNum
    or secondNum < thirdNum or firstNum < thirdNum. Meaning, if my firstNum was 6, second was 5 and third was 7,
    the condition would return true because 'or' would check if second is smaller than 7.
    The 'or' operator would check if either one is true and return true.

        We console log this just for test and the result is true if:
        firstNum < secondNum and secondNum < thirdNum and firstNum < thirdNum. 
        Our numbers are increasing.
        */

    /*
        Now, the other check is pretty clear. We just need to use > operator
        to check if first is greater than second, second is greater than third, 
        and first is greater than third.

        //Console log again to double check before alert.
        //console.log('Decreasing order.');

        alert('Decreasing order.');
    
    /* 
        Now for everything else, we return: 'Neither increasing or decreasing order.'
        This time, this condition will return true, unlike the previous one done
        in Control Statements - Activity 1.
        This condition will return true if: firstNum = 15, secondNum = 1, third = 1.
        We don't want to use less or eqal or greater or eqal because if we
        input 1, 1, 1 the first statement and the second will return true and we don't want that.
