    /*
        In this activity we must create two functions:
        - to show the array content
        - to find the max value of the array
    */

    //We first define the array:
    const arr = [10, 2, 3, 4, 7];

    //We create the first function that takes a parameter:
    function printArr(param) {
        console.log(`The content of the array is: ${param}`);
    }
    //then we call the function with the array as parameter:
    printArr(arr);


    //Now for the second function.
    //We again need to create a function that takes one parameter:
    function getMaxNum(param) {
        //we define max as arr index 0 so we can compare the first element with all elements
        let max = param[0];

        //then we do the iteration as usual:
        //We start with second element because there is no point to check if first element 0 is less than itself
        for (let i = 1; i < param.length; i++) {
            //If the number we are checking against first value in array 
            //is greater than it, we update max with its value
            if (param[i] > max) {
                max = param[i];
            }
        }
        //We now log the greatest number in that array.
        console.log(`The max value in the array is: ${max}`);
    }

    getMaxNum(arr);
