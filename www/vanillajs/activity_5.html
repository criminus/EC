    <p>Let's check each number that is smaller or equal to: <span id="checkTo"></span></p>
    Let's now check each number:<br>
    <div id="numbersOddEven"></div>

    <script>
        //We define the max number we want to stop at
        let checkTo = 15;

        //We print its value in our HTML span
        document.getElementById('checkTo').textContent = checkTo;

        //In this case we start to check each number including 0, to checkTo which is 15
        // then we increase each number with 1 (++) until we reach the condition:
        //if 0 is smaller or equal to 15.
        for (i = 0; i <= checkTo; i++) {
            //We now use a ternary condition to check if the number is either even or odd
            //The ternary condition is very simple: condition ? expression1 : expression2
            //In our example we check if the number can be divided with 2 and the rest is 0
            //in case it's not 0 it will return odd.
            let isEvenOdd = i % 2 == 0 ? 'is even' : 'is odd';
            //Now for the display part, we insert each value in the HTML numbersOddEven by adding a + sign before the = operator.
            document.getElementById('numbersOddEven').innerHTML += `${i} ${isEvenOdd}<br>`;
        }
    </script>
