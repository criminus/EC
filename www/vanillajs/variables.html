        //Assign a value for two variables
        x = 5;
        y = 6;

        //Let's also print this in our div id.
        document.getElementById("result").innerHTML = z;

        //Let's do a basic check and if the result is not 11 we display an alert message.

        //We can use string "Hello[space]" then comma then variable name
        console.log("Hello ", name);
