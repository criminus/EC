    /*
        In this activity we must create a function that checks if a number is prime
        or not.
        A prime number can only be divisible by 1 or itself.
        Example: 
            2 can be divided by 1 or 2 (2/1 = 2; 2/2 = 1)
            3 can be divided only by 1 or itself (3/1 = 3 ; 3/3 = 1)
            4 is not a prime because it can be divided by 1, 2, and itself 4.
    */

    function isPrimeNum(num) {
        //We first need to check if the number is less or equal to 1 or if it's not integer
        if (num <= 1 || !Number.isInteger(num)) {
            return false;
        }

        //Check if the number is divisible by any integer from 2 to halfway point
        for (let i = 2; i <= num / 2; i++) {
            if (num % 1 === 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        //If the number is not divisible by any integer from 2 to halfway point, it's prime
        return true;
    }

    //Let's check for different numbers and see the output:
    console.log(isPrimeNum(6));
    console.log(isPrimeNum(2));
    console.log(isPrimeNum(3));
    console.log(isPrimeNum(-2.5));
    console.log(isPrimeNum(16));
